Dig Too Deep
############

The traditional activity of a dwarven civilisation:  digging ever downwards,
driven by greed for some marvelous material.  But beware, for there are older
and fouler things than mere goblins in the deep places of the world.

No tutorial is necessary for this one.  Just go down, through the cavern
layers, and keep digging...
