Setting up your install
#######################

For most people, the :DFFD:`standard pack <11171>` is the best way
to get started - but not always.  If you're on OSX or Linux, or
have some other reason to avoid the preset walkthrough pack, here's
what you'll need:

#. `Dwarf Fortress <http://bay12games.com/dwarves/>`_
#. :forums:`DFHack <139553>`
#. :wiki:`A graphics pack <Graphics_set_repository>`
#. The save file from the standard pack (yep, download it anyway!)

The easiest way to get all this working is usually via a
:wiki:`Starter Pack <Utility:Lazy_Newb_Pack>`, which are also suitable
for more advanced players (eg if you want to dive into the tutorials
or even a masterclass).

Just add :download:`this file <onLoadWorld.init>` to your DF
folder; it configures DFHack to automate away many of the worst pain
points for new players.

Instructions for how to set up all of the components individually are
beyond the scope of this quick guide, so check the link for each and
experiment if anything is unclear.
